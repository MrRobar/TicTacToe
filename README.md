# TicTacToe
The main idea of this project was to understand how to make a tic tac toe game using one dimensional array as a game field.
Another task was to make winning combination check as effective as possible and not using "brute force" and making 3 checks per horizontal and vertical lines.
Instead, a changed ID of a cell was used to determine which line to check and do this using one for loop only.
